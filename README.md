This application is using Vuex as a state manager and Vue-router as a routing system.
Also, For a better UI experience, I'm using Ant design Vue.
In the router.js file, you will see that we have 4 different routes to handle our Home, quiz, quiz result, and not found pages. 
Project folders have been categorized into four sections, 
1- The assets of the project.
2- Pages, in this folder you can find the main handler file for our modules. 
3- Components, each page contains multiple reusable components, and those components will be added to the Components folder
4- Last but not least our Store folder, all the actions, mutations, and getters will be added to this folder.
